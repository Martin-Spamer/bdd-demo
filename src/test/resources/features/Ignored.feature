Feature: An example feature for testing
	As an advocate of Behaviour Driven Development
	I want to demonstrate how to ignore a test
	So that I can show automated testing with behaviour driven development

@Ignore
Scenario: Object of scenario
	Given pre-conditions are true
	When activity is carried out
	Then the outcome is validated
